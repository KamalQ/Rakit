        <img src="{% static 'images\Vision.jpg' %}" width="400" height="400" align="right"> Many people have either invested their time and money into trading or hope to get started. Some people may be too hesitant to make a trade because they don’t want to make a bad and uninformed decision and waste their money. Conducting research is the obvious solution, but many people don’t have the time or resources to gain substantial information. Their best option is just to look at the history of the price of the stock they are interested in and what others are saying about it. This variety of information may be difficult for someone to filter through and piece together. It won’t be easy for someone to arrive at a conclusion about which action to take or make a prediction about the price. Additionally, this doesn’t give them information about their potential risk involved. Trading can be especially intimidating and difficult for students, when it comes to investing for the first time or even investing with fake money in a simulation for a school assignment. Trading can be especially more difficult to get into for some of these students because they also have less experience and likely know very little about trading.
        <br/> Creating a software application, that would allow traders and students to quickly gain access to history and informed predictions of stock prices based off a wide variety of factors, would make them less hesitant to trade. Knowing their projected risk would encourage them to trade more frequently without having to put in the time and effort to conduct incomplete research.
        <br/>Our goal is to provide users with clear information tailored to their interest to aid them in making informed trades and assess their risk.
